# Gene Technology Lab Course

Hello and welcome to the Gene Technology lab course landing page! This GitHub
repository contains all the instructions and material for the computer labs for
the two courses [CB2040](https://github.com/almaan/genetech/tree/cb2040) and 
[BB2255](https://github.com/almaan/genetech/tree/bb2255). Since the two 
aforementioned courses have a large overlap in content we store it at the same place.

For the computer labs, we'll be using the programming language R which is particularly 
useful for statistical computing and data visualization. R is together with Python one 
of the most popular languages for biological research and comes with a large ecosystem 
of open source packages to process and analyze biological data. 

As we (the TAs) are constantly trying to improve the course, we have decided to try 
something new for this year that we are hoping will make it easier for you to get started. 
Previous years, we have tried to provide instructions for how to set up a working R 
environment on the students own laptops, but we have realized that this is quite the 
challenge since students have access to different hardware and operating systems. We don't
want you to spend hours and hours stuck trying to intepret and solve error messages, so 
instead we are going to use a cloud based solution that only requires you to have a 
decent internet connection!

[RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a cloud-based solution where everything
is preinstalled and ready to go. You will be provided with login details so that you 
can start coding directly from a web browser. 

For information about the computer exercises, you need to switch from the
_master branch_ of this repository to your course specific branch. To do this,
simply find the tab on this page that says "master", click it and select the
branch that corresponds to your course code (see image below):

**Note**: read through this page before switching to your course specific page.

## Getting started with RStudio cloud

Before you start working, you should have received an invite from the TAs. If
you click on the invite you will be redirected to this page where you can setup 
a new account:

![join-rstudio-cloud](imgs/join.png)

When you have created an account and is logged in to RStudio cloud, you should 
see something like this:

![assignment-contributor](imgs/assignmentContributor.png)

If it's the first time you log in, you press the start button which will create 
a copy of the "genetech" project that will be your own. If you already have created a copy, 
you will see a continue button to access your project.
